            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>After their Families.]</hi> It appears by VII <hi>Joſhua</hi> 16, 17, &amp;c. that the ſeveral <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were divided into <hi>Families;</hi> and thoſe <hi>Families</hi> into <hi>Houſholds;</hi> and thoſe <hi>Houſholds</hi> had every one of them an <hi>Head</hi> or Chief; who is called the <hi>Father</hi> of it. There were LXX. of theſe <hi>Families</hi> in all: but ſome Tribes had more, others fewer; according to the number of Souls (as they are called) that is, Perſons who were in each when they went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> XLVI <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>With the number of their Names.]</hi> The Names of every Perſon in the ſeveral Houſes, were ſet down and regiſtred; that they might be the better known.</p>

                  <hi>All that are able to go forth to war in Iſrael.]</hi> One would think by this, they were not to number very aged and decrepit People: becauſe they were no more able to go to war, than Women and Children, and thoſe under twenty years old. And if we may believe <hi>Joſephus (L.</hi> II. <hi>Antiq. cap.</hi> 9.) after fifty Years old, Men were not bound to pay the half Shekel
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64708:6"/>
which was due in ſuch Muſters: and therefore we may reaſonably think were excuſed from going to war; unleſs they had a mind themſelves.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64708:6"/>
there is this Objection againſt it, That <hi>Nahſhan,</hi> who is named for the Tribe of <hi>Judah, v.</hi> 7. was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Firſt-born of that Tribe. For <hi>Pharez</hi> was not <hi>Judah</hi>'s eldeſt Son; <hi>Selah</hi> being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: who had Children, as we find XXVI of this Book, <hi>v.</hi> 20. Beſides, when the Princes of the Tribes rre reckoned again (XXXIV of this Book) in the laſt Year of their abode in the Wilderneſs; none of them are derived from theſe Men here mentioned, but from others. And therefore theſe were the moſt eminent Men in the ſeveral Tribes, upon a different account; either for Wiſdom, or Valour, or ſome other excellent quality.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Tribe of Reuben, Elizur the Son of Shedeur.]</hi> There is little to be obſerved concerning theſe Tribes, but that they are here placed, not in the order of their Birth; but of their Mothers who bare them. Firſt, the Children of <hi>Leah:</hi> who are all reckoned in the ſame order, wherein they were born of her, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. Then the Children of <hi>Rachel, v.</hi> 10, 11. And after them the Children of the two Hand-maids, in the <hi>four</hi> following <hi>Verſes.</hi> Where, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Dan</hi> is ſet firſt; he being the Firſt-born of <hi>Bilhah;</hi> whom <hi>Rachel</hi> gave <hi>Jacob</hi> for his Wife, XXX <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. But then, the next that follow are not reckoned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of their Birth: for <hi>Naphtali</hi> who was born next, is placed the laſt; and the youngeſt Son of <hi>Zilpah</hi> placed before the eldeſt. For which we cannot now diſcern the reaſon; though it is likely it was upon the account of ſome Pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence or other which they had gained; as <hi>Ephraim</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64708:7"/>

every one of the Firſt-born to come, and put in his Hand, and draw out a Schedule: And to him that drew out one of the former ſort, he ſaid, <hi>a Levite hath redeemed thee;</hi> but to him that drew out one of the latter, he ſaid, <hi>pay thy Price.</hi> And thus they tell the Story alſo in the <hi>Gemara Babylon.

her.</hi> And ſo <hi>Abarbinel</hi> expounds it, the <hi>Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates that this Sacrifice was brought by the Husband for the ſake of his Wife; for he had done nothing that needed a Sacrifice.</hi> Nor is <hi>Chaskuni</hi> his reaſon of any moment; for there is nothing ſaid to make us look upon this, as an expiatory Sacrifice; but the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of it was (as <hi>Wagenſeil</hi> well obſerves, <hi>Annot.</hi> in <hi>Miſchna Sota, Cap.</hi> II. <hi>p.</hi> 349.) to ſupplicate the Divine Majeſty, that he would be pleaſed to clear the Woman's Innocence if ſhe were cauſeleſly ſuſpected; or otherwiſe diſcover, and puniſh her Guilt.</p>
               <p>By this it appears, that if the Proceſs was began in ſome Court below, (as the Jews affirm) the Cauſe was removed to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (where only they could ſacrifice, when the Ark of God's Preſence was ſetled there) and brought before the great <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi> Who putting her Husband out of the Court, (as they ſay in the next Section of the fore-named <hi>Miſchna)</hi> and having the Woman alone by her ſelf, endeavoured firſt by ſtriking a Terror into her, and then by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her good words, to perſwade her to tell the Truth: Saying, <hi>Dear Daughter, perhaps thou waſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-taken by drinking too Much Wine, or waſt in a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Humour, or carried away by the Heat of Youth, or by the Example of evil Neighbours: Come, confeſs the Truth, for the ſake of his great Name, which is deſcribed in the moſt ſacred Ceremony: and do not let it be blotted out, (v.</hi> 23.) <hi>with the bitter Water.</hi> If after this, ſhe confeſſed the Fact, ſaying, <hi>I am defiled;</hi> then ſhe was to tear the Inſtrument of her Dowry in pieces, and go whether ſhe pleaſed.

                  <hi>The tenth part of an Ephah of Barly-meal.]</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Offering of this ſort, was of fine Wheat-flour: only this, and the Sheaf, or handful mentioned XXIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. were of Barly.

Where the reaſon given for this Barly-offering is, becauſe ſhe was ſuppoſed to have committed the Act of a Beaſt, (which is not confined to one) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was to Sacrifice the Food of a Beaſt: for ſo Barly was in <hi>Judaea.</hi> Many ſuch pretty, rather than ſolid Reaſons, are collected out of their Authors by <hi>Simeon de Muis</hi> in his <hi>Varia Sacra</hi> upon this place. The ſimpleſt Reaſon ſeems to be, that a viler ſort of Sacrifice, was moſt ſutable to her vile Condition: for which reaſon alſo there was no Oyl nor Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe permitted to be offered with it, as it here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall pour no Oyl upon it, nor put Frankincenſe thereon.]</hi> This Sacrifice was different from all other of this kind, (See <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.) For though that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned V <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. was to have no Oyl nor Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe with it; yet it was of fine Flour, and not Barly. And though the Sheaf mentioned XXIII <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. was of Barly, yet it was ſifted: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Oyl and Frankincenſe were uſed with it; which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64708:41"/>
are here forbidden. The reaſons of which are given by the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to their various Fancies. And ſome of them are ingenious enough; as that a good Name being compared to Oyl, (VII <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.) it is here omitted, becauſe the Woman had loſt her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. <hi>Maimonides</hi> is a little more judicious: for looking upon Oyl and Frankincenſe as added unto Sacrifices for the Honour and Dignity of them, he thinks God would have this Splendor (as his word is) to be wanting to ſuch a Woman's Sacrifice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the baſeneſs of her behaviour, which was the occaſion of it. As if ſhe had been told (to ſtir her up to repentance) <hi>becauſe of the filthineſs of thy actions, thy Oblation is more imperfect than others, More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 46. But none, I think, hath given a better account of this, than St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi> V. <hi>ad v.

and to plait it in Locks, that they might at a certain time cut it off, and devote it to ſome of their Gods: that in all likelyhood the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their Superſtition, if God, to prevent it, had not inſtituted a way of doing what the reſt of the World did, without their Idolatry.

For the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> are here directed to cut their Hair (when the time of their Separation was compleated) at the Door of the Tabernacle; where it was alſo to be burnt: whereas the <hi>Gentiles</hi> hung their Hair, when they had cut it, upon Trees; or Conſecrated it to <hi>Rivers,</hi> (as I obſerved <hi>v.</hi> 5.) or laid it up in their Temples, there to be preſerved. The Hebrew <hi>Nazarites</hi> alſo are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to offer various ſorts of Sacrifices, when they cut their Hair; of which we rarely read any thing among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And all the time of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration were to drink no Wine, nor eat Grapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was not known among the Heathen. From whence it is, one may think, that they are ſo often put in mind of the LORD, in this Law of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites.</hi> Who are ſaid to be <hi>Separated unto the LORD,</hi> v. 1, 5, 6. and the <hi>Conſecration of his God</hi> is ſaid to be upon his Head, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and all the days of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration he was <hi>holy to the LORD,</hi> v. 8. unto whom he <hi>conſecrated the days of his Separation,</hi> v. 12. To put them in mind, that though they uſed this Rite, which was common to other Nations, yet it was in honour of the LORD only; whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the Author of Health, and Strength, and Growth. For the Devil alſo had his <hi>Nazarites,</hi> as appears from IX <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10. All this is ſaid, and much more, with a ſpecious ſhow of Truth, by a

               <p>But there are two things wanting to make this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion probable. <hi>First,</hi> None can tell how the World came by ſuch a Cuſtom of letting their Hair grow for Sacred uſes; unleſs they had it from <hi>Moſes.</hi> Who tells us whence he derived it, <hi>viz.</hi> from God: who appointed this Rite for ſuch Reaſons, as then were plain, but now, perhaps do not appear to us. Beſides, <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is not the leaſt Evidence that this Cuſtom was ſo old as <hi>Moſes</hi> his time: which to me ſeems not likely, but rather that it was derived, among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> from an imperfect Knowledge of what is here ordained by <hi>Moſes.</hi> For the chief part of this Nazariteſhip, conſiſting in letting their Hair grow, and conſecrating it unto God, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> took it to be a piece of great Devotion, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Many Authors have written much of this Cuſtom; for which there was a certain day appointed at <hi>Athens, viz.</hi> the third day of the Feaſt called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe then the Hair of their grown Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren was ſhorn off, and ſacrificed to <hi>Diana.</hi> See <hi>Petr. Caſtellanus</hi> in his <hi>Syntagma de Feſtis Graecorum.</hi> Where he quotes a paſſage out of <hi>Heſychius (p.</hi> 28.) who ſays, That before they cut off their Hair, they brought a Meaſure of Wine, which they offered to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and then all that were preſent drunk of it. Which is ſome imitation of the <hi>Drink-offering</hi> here mentioned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was offered at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64708:57"/>
of their Nazariteſhip. And <hi>Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Huetius</hi> have made it ſo plain that the <hi>Attick</hi> Laws were derived from <hi>Moſes;</hi> that I cannot doubt but this Cuſtom alſo flowed from the ſame Fountain.</p>
               <p>And if we muſt give an account of the reaſon of this Inſtitution among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> I think that of <hi>Maimonides</hi> is better then this againſt which I have excepted, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Law about their Hair was made in oppoſition to the opinion of the ancient Idolaters, called <hi>Zabij;</hi> who held all things which were ſeparated from the Body to be impure; as the Hair, the Nails, and the Blood. From whence, all Barbers among them were accounted impure Perſons, becauſe they cut Men's Hair, and let Blood.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>89</label> of the Congregation, to ſpeak with him]</hi> That is, with God. This ſeems to be here mentioned, becauſe he had lately had a ſpecial occaſion to go and enquire particularly of God, about a matter of great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as will appear from IX. 8, 9. And it is likely he had gone in twice upon this occaſion, to conſult him about the Offering of the Princes, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 10, 11. And now, it is poſſible, went in again to know if the LORD would give him any further Directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he heard the voice of one ſpeaking unto him from off the Mercy-ſeat,</hi> &amp;c.] There God promiſed to meet him, and to commune with him, &amp;c. XXV <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64708:66"/>
God appeared and communed with him from thence, which was by a <hi>voice,</hi> that he heard of one ſpeaking to him, as he ſtood in the outward part of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.

So they obſerve in <hi>Siphra,</hi> as <hi>Butxtorf</hi> notes in his <hi>Hiſtor. Arca Foederis, cap.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſpake unto him.]</hi> With an audible voice; and ſo diſtinctly, that he perceived and underſtood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word. Which <hi>Abarbinel</hi> thinks God vouchſafed for this reaſon; That as he viſibly repreſented to him in the Mount the pattern of the Tabernacle, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing belonging to it, whereby the form and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of every particular was imprinted on his Mind, and he was the better able to give directions how to make them exactly: So he being to write in his Law all that God required them to do, he delivered every thing to him in an audible voice; that he might ſet down in theſe Books the very Words and Phraſes which he heard with his Ears from the Mouth of God, as plainly as if he had deſcribed them from ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Volume.</p>
               <p>To which I cannot but add, That this audible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate voice from God, which was perceived by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ears, repreſented God as if he was incorporate: and may well be lookt upon as an earneſt of that great Myſtery, <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh;</hi> who in the Fulneſs of Time became a Man, and ſpake to all the <hi>Jews</hi> familiarly in their own Language.</p>

Beſides, theſe ſilver Trumpets ſeem to have been uſed only at the Sanctuary; and other Trumpets were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when they went to War. For at the Siege of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo,</hi> the Prieſts blew with Horns, not with theſe ſilver Trumpets. Therefore they may well be thought here to have called them to the Sanctuary to pray to God, before they went to War; and that by blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Alarm; whereby they underſtood the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Summons. And if we may believe the <hi>Jews,</hi> they uſed, when the Temple was built, to <hi>blow an Alarm</hi> every Morning, at the opening of the Gates of it; particularly at the opening of the <hi>East</hi> Gate, called the Gate of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> obſerves in the place above-named) For which, though there was no expreſs Command, yet it was grounded on this Reaſon, That the <hi>Levites,</hi> who were God's Hoſt, (as they are often called in this Book, IV. 3, &amp;c. VIII. 24.) might be awakened to come and attend their Service in the Houſe of God.</p>

From which God intended to preſerve his People, by appointing ſpecial Sacrifices (with blowing of Trumpets) to be offered unto himſelf at that time.

For, no doubt, the Cloud ſtood ſtill, (though it did not come down and ſettle, as I ſaid, X. 33.) that they might make ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Reſts in their Journey: elſe how ſhould they gather the <hi>Manna</hi> that fell every Night about their Tents, and would keep but one Day, as we read XVI <hi>Exod.</hi> I conclude therefore that this Mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was the beginning of thoſe loud Complaints, which were made a little after, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, &amp;c. becauſe they were not brought by this Removal to a place, where they might have had other Food than <hi>Manna:</hi> of which they now grew weary, having lived upon it near a whole Year.</p>

                  <hi>Who ſhall give us fleſh to eat?]</hi> It is an Expreſſion of a vehement, impatient Deſire (mixed with Deſpair) after fleſh-Meat.

(where there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed made of <hi>Seventy,</hi> but he gathers it from what followed) and thoſe were the <hi>Seventy</hi> whom we find at the giving of the Law, a little after they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> XXIV <hi>Exod.</hi> 1, 9. who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nobles,</hi> or Great Men, <hi>v.</hi> 11.

               <p>
                  <hi>Whom thou knowest to be the Elders of the People.]</hi> For there were many Elders, out of whom <hi>Seventy</hi> were choſen. See XXIV <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Officers over them.]</hi> That is, ſaith <hi>R.

Which word <hi>Officers</hi> doth not ſignifie Men that had any Judicial Authority; but only ſuch as had an inſpection over others, to ſee they did their Work, and to give an account of them.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64708:95"/>
Underſtanding and Breeding, which advanced them to be Inſpectors of others. And therefore the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> rightly obſerve, that <hi>the Elders and Officers</hi> here mentioned, were, no doubt, Men of Wiſdom and Judgment; who knew how to uſe the Authority that was committed to them. And it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable (as ſome of them affirm) that they were choſen out of thoſe leſſer Courts, which were erected by the Advice of <hi>Jethro.</hi> See <hi>Selden</hi> in the ſame place, <hi>ſect.</hi> 5. who at large confutes <hi>Baronius</hi> and others; who ſay that the number of the great <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> (which deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved its Original from hence) was <hi>Seventy two:</hi> and makes it appear they were only <hi>Seventy;</hi> and with <hi>Moſes</hi> their Head <hi>Seventy one, ſect.</hi> 8.

him to ſpeak either Pſalms, or Hymns; or wholeſome Precepts of living; or about Political Affairs, and Civil Government, far beyond his Natural Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and all this waking, and in the full vigour of his Senſes.

The Jews (particularly <hi>Solomon Jarchi</hi>) ſay they were choſen by the way of caſting Lots; and according to their manner they tell the Story thus, in the place mentioned before in the <hi>Gemara. Moſes,</hi> ſay they, was in doubt how he ſhould exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute God's Command, <hi>v.</hi> 16. becauſe if he did not chuſe an equal number out of every Tribe, it might be ill taken. And if he choſe <hi>Six</hi> out of each of the XII Tribes, they would exceed the number of LXX; if but <hi>five,</hi> they would fall ſhort of it. He reſolved therefore at laſt to chuſe VI out of each Tribe, which in all were LXXII Perſons: And in LXX Schedules he wrote the Name of Elder; but the other two were Blanks. Then mixing all theſe in an Urn, he bad them come and draw: And to every one who drew a Schedule, that had the Name of Elder in it, he ſaid, <hi>God hath ſanctified thee;</hi> but to him that drew a Blank, he ſaid, God hath not choſen thee. And thoſe two Blanks, ſome of the Jewiſh Doctors
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64708:101"/>
ſay, came into the hands of <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad:</hi> who therefore were left behind in the Camp. And this Conceit our very learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, ſaying (in his ſhort account of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>That ſix of a Tribe, made up the number of the Sanhedrim, (which was choſen) and two over. And thoſe two were</hi> Eldad <hi>and</hi> Medad; <hi>who were written for Elders, but the Lot caſt them out; that there might be but LXX. Yet did the LORD honour them with the Spirit of Prophecy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as this whole Story, of the manner of Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Elders, is very dubious; ſo other Jews of great Authority, ſay, that <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> were of the number of the LXX that were choſen. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſaith expreſly, they were of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, whoſe Schedules came up, with the Name of Elder in them: But they did not go to the Tabernacle, becauſe they had no mind to be Governours. Nay the <hi>Talmudical</hi> Gloſs upon the fore-named place of the <hi>Gemara,</hi> ſaith, that when LXX of the LXXII had drawn, two of them had Blanks; whereby <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> knew that the two remaining Schedules had the Name of Elder in them: and therefore would not draw them, becauſe they were ſure not to have Blanks. The very ſame Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſhows, is in other noted Books of theirs. So that it is generally received, they were in the number of thoſe LXX which were choſen to be joined with <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Government. See <hi>L.</hi> II. <hi>de Synedr.

Where he hath a long Diſcourſe (to which I refer the Reader) to ſhow that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> do not take the word <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lau</hi> (here uſed) to ſignifie <hi>Quails:</hi> but we take that tranſlation of it only from <hi>Joſephus.</hi> See what I have noted on XVI <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. The no leſs learned <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus,</hi> indeed, hath ſaid a great deal to juſtifie <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus:</hi> and hath ſhown that <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Regions abound ſtill with <hi>Quails;</hi> from whence this Wind blew fair to bring them to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And every one knows, that there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Winds called <hi>Ornithia's;</hi> from their bringing great Flights of Birds along with them. <hi>Quails</hi> alſo he obſerves are wont to fly from the <hi>Southern</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to the <hi>Northern,</hi> in the Spring time, (as it now was) and to fall ſometimes in ſuch vaſt quantities, as to ſink a Ship. Notwithſtanding all which, and a great deal more, which he alledges, with great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there are ſeveral things ſaid in the following
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64708:103"/>
Relation, which by no means can be brought to agree to <hi>Quails:</hi> and therefore <hi>Ludolphus</hi> rather takes <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lau</hi> to ſignifie <hi>Locuſts;</hi> by which it is eaſie to give a plain Explication of all that is ſaid of them. It is certain, they were not only uſed for Food, in thoſe Parts of the World: but that ſome of them were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delicious Meat in ſeveral Countries: for they that have eaten them, (See XI <hi>Lev.</hi> 22.) compare them to young Pigeons; or to a freſh Herring; or to a Crab, or Lobſter, (like to which they are in Shape and Figure) and they are ſeveral ways prepared, and accounted very wholſome Food; when they have thrown away the Heads, and Wings and Leggs. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that ſome Parts of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> lived upon them; and that they were preſerved, <hi>fumo &amp; ſale,</hi> by being dried in the Smoak and ſalted, for their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, throughout the whole Year. Now all that is ſaid in this, and in the following <hi>verſes,</hi> will have a plain and eaſie meaning, (as I ſaid) if we follow this Interpretation: but not, if we take them for <hi>Quails,</hi> or <hi>Pheaſants,</hi> or <hi>Sea-fowl.</hi> As for example, what was ſaid before, concerning God's ſending a mighty Wind, is not hard to underſtand, if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to ſpeak of <hi>Locuſts;</hi> which all Authors ſay are brought with a Wind: But it was never heard to bring <hi>Quails,</hi> which cannot fly high, nor far; much leſs ſo far, as from the Sea to the middle of <hi>Arabia Petraea.</hi> Nor would the Locuſts have come this way, had not this Wind brought them from their ordinary Courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the Sea.] Viz.</hi> From the <hi>Red-ſea;</hi> yet not excluding the <hi>Perſian Gulph.</hi> Which muſt not be underſtood, as if they came out of the Sea; but from the Sea-coaſt: And it is very probable out of <hi>Africa,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>As it were a days journey on this ſide, and as it were a days journey on the other ſide.]</hi> A days Journey, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> makes account, is at leaſt <hi>Twenty</hi> Miles. See the place before-named, <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> II. <hi>Lib.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. <hi>p.</hi> 105.

And if we reſort to that, what need was there of a Wind to bring them, when God muſt be ſuppoſed miraculouſly to have created them, as he did <hi>Manna.</hi> And yet ſuch a quantity of <hi>Quails</hi> was not to be found any where, without a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, as would cover the Heavens <hi>forty</hi> Miles (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Bochartus</hi>) on all ſides. But that which would have been, on many accounts miraculous, if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of <hi>Quails,</hi> will be found leſs wonderful, or rather natural, if it be underſtood of <hi>Locuſts:</hi> who come in very great, and thick Clouds, which darken the Sky; as all Authors tell us.

                  <hi>And as it were two Cubits high, upon the face of the Earth.]</hi> This Interpreters look upon as impoſſible: for then the <hi>Quails</hi> would have been choaked and ſtifled; if they had been heaped ſo deep one upon another. And therefore they have deviſed the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a new word; and refer this not to their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the Ground, but to their <hi>flying in the Air,</hi> two Cubits high above the Earth: that ſo they might the more eaſily be taken by their Hands. So the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo <hi>Val.

And therefore it is better to expound it of <hi>Locuſts;</hi> who though they fall one upon another, to a great depth, are not thereby ſuffocated: by reaſon of the length of their Feet, and the thinneſs of their Wings.</p>

But it is to be conſidered, that as it was a greater Fault to fall into the ſame Sin again, after God had been ſo good to them; ſo they were not in ſuch Neceſſity now, as they were then; when they were really pinched with hunger: whereas now they were fed with Bread from Heaven; and therefore cried for Meat, not out of need, but wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs.

So they interpret the following words; <hi>for he had married an Aethiopian Woman:</hi> as if his mere Marriage with her, was the thing they ſpake againſt.

which if they had diſliked, one would think ſhould have, long before now, been charged upon him as a Fault.

And moreover the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> VI. 4. mentions them, as Conductors of the People, while they were in the Wilderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Moſes.</hi> Which might make them ſtomach it, that he took no notice of them, when he choſe the LXX Elders, who were to be his Co-adjutors; but did it of himſelf.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>3</label> the Men which were upon the face of the Earth.]</hi> This is added as the Reaſon, why he paſſed by the Affront they put upon him, and why God avenged it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſo exceeding meek and patient, (or as others tranſlate it, ſo humble and lowly) that he would have been expoſed to further Affronts, if God had not chaſtiſed their Inſolence. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo might think fit to ſet this down, as a Confutation of their Charge againſt him; being ſo far from that Pride which they imputed to him, that he did not reſent (though he was ſo very much above them) their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful Behaviour towards him. Who had converſed immediately with God himſelf, and been with him in the Holy Mount many days together; who ſent ſeveral Commands to <hi>Aaron,</hi> as well as to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by him alone: Which made ſuch a Difference between him and all others, that as it was an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Arrogance in them to equal themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; ſo he demonſtrated how far he was from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64708:108"/>
proud of his Superiority, by meekly bearing their haughty Behaviour towards him.</p>
               <p>So little cauſe there is for their Cavils, who from hence argue, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of theſe Books; becauſe he commends himſelf in them. For this is not ſo much a Commendation, as a neceſſary Account, of himſelf; to ſhow how cauſleſs their Charge againſt him was. To ſuch Vindications of themſelves the humbleſt Souls may be conſtrained, by the Calumnies of wicked Men: As we ſee not only in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but our bleſſed Saviour, who were put upon Glorying, and Magnifying themſelves, by the Malignity of their Enemies. See X <hi>Joh.</hi> 36. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> XI. 10, 23, &amp;c. And this is the more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable; when Men know not only that they write the Truth, but that it is notorious to all that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, and cannot be contradicted. The holy Writers alſo are not to be confined to our Rules; being moved by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to ſet down ſuch things, which if they had been left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would not have mentioned. And Men who have a due Reverence to the Holy Scriptures, will look upon this rather as the Holy Ghoſt's Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning <hi>Moſes,</hi> than <hi>Moſes</hi> his Teſtimony concerning himſelf. But we have to do now with a Generation of Men, that write upon theſe Books, not as of a Divine Original, but as they do upon common Authors.</p>

               <p>Whether there were, in thoſe days, Men brought up and trained, to be made fit to receive this Gift beſtow'd upon them; we do not know: But in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-times, it is evident there were certain Colledges of Prophets, wherein Diſciples of Prophets were bred.

Though God did not tye himſelf to diſpenſe it to ſuch Perſons alone; but beſtowed it upon whom he pleaſed, though they had ſpent no time in thoſe Schools of the Prophets. This is apparent from that Proverbial Speech, <hi>Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> X. 11. XIX. 24. This had been no wonder (as this Saying imports) if it had been uſual for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be endowed with this Gift, on a ſudden; who was never bred up in ſuch a courſe, as led to it. But to ſhow how this came to paſs, <hi>one of that place anſwered and ſaid,</hi> (as it there follows, <hi>v.</hi> 12.) <hi>but who is their Father?</hi> That is, this is no ſuch wonder, if it be conſidered, who makes Men Prophets; <hi>viz.</hi> God, who is the Father of all the Children of the Prophets; and therefore may inſpire whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

As he now might have imparted this Gift, to meaner Perſons than the LXX Elders preſented to him by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and made them equal, if he had thought fit, with <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam.</hi> For this was the caſe of <hi>Amos,</hi> in after-ages; who was <hi>no Prophet, nor a Prophet's Son,</hi> (as he himſelf relates, VII. 14.) <hi>but an Herds-man;</hi> and yet <hi>the LORD took him, as he followed the Flock, and bad him go and propheſie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his People Iſrael.</hi>

                  <hi>In a Viſion.]</hi> This was one way of diſcovering his Mind to the Prophets; by repreſenting things to them, when they were awake, as if they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them by their Senſes; which at that time were lockt up, and all tranſacted by a Divine Operation upon their Mind and Imagination. See XV <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and VIII <hi>Dan.</hi> 1, 15. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> mentions one, who obſerves that the word <hi>Marah</hi> (the Plural of which <hi>Maroth</hi> ſignifies <hi>Looking-Glaſſes,</hi> in XXXVIII <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.) is a different word from <hi>Mareh,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed for <hi>Viſion.</hi> And teaches us, that all the Repreſentations made in this way to the Prophets, were only as the Images of things repreſented in a Glaſs; in which we behold the outward Shape, or Shadow, as we may call it; but not the thing it ſelf. And ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to have underſtood this word (if he alludes to this place, as <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks he doth) when he ſaith, <hi>now we ſee,</hi>

And both theſe ſeem ſome times to have been mixed together, or to have followed one another; as in XVI <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. VII <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. VIII. 16, 17, 18.

For if they ſaw the People of the Country every where, as they paſſed along, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Neighbours to their Graves, (as the Jews tell the Tale) this which they ſhould have aſcribed to the Providence of God, who ſent this Mortality that they might have fewer Enemies to oppoſe them, and that theſe Spies might paſs more freely, and leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; they moſt wickedly aſcribe to the badneſs of the Air: which being very unhealthful to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, might well be thought would be much more ſo to Strangers.

Where a Funeral-Feaſt (as the manner was) being one day made under certain Cedar-trees, which are very ſhady; the Spies got up to the top of them, to hide themſelves among the thick Boughs. But the People below hapning to look up, the Spies heard them ſay, there are Men got up into the Trees, who look like Graſhoppers.

               <p>By all which it appears, that they had not only a ſight of the <hi>Anakims,</hi> but the <hi>Anakims</hi> alſo ſaw them; and lookt upon them, it is likely, as they did upon other Travellers; who were wont to come thither, either for their Pleaſure, or to traffick in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; or in their way to other places.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64708:140"/>
And therefore an excellent Perſon of our own, after long conſideration of this matter, comes to this concluſion, That in <hi>Leviticus</hi> he requires a young Bullock to be ſlain for a Sin-offering, when the whole Congregation, though adhering to the true Worſhip of God in every thing, were led ignorantly to do ſomething againſt ſome Negative Precept (as they call it) to practiſe, that is, what God had forbidden, (ſo thoſe words ſeem to import, IV <hi>Lev.</hi> 13, 14.) but this Kid of the Goats here mentioned for a Sin-offering, together with a young Bullock for a Burnt-offering, was to be ſacrificed, when all the People forgetting the holy Rites preſcribed by <hi>Moſes</hi> (which often hapned under bad Kings) fell by a common Error into Idolatrous Worſhip: which agrees very well with what is ſaid in the two <hi>verſes</hi> before-going: where he ſpeaks, as I noted, of not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe holy Rites about Sacrifices.

For no Man worſhipped a Star, or a Planet, but he that believed its Eternity: which is the moſt repugnant of all other things to the Law of God; which in the very firſt words of it declares, that all the World had a beginning, and was made by him

whom the <hi>Jews</hi> worſhipped.</q> Thus he. But doing any thing <hi>with an high hand,</hi> doth not ſignifie any one certain kind of Sin, as the <hi>Jews</hi> generally fancy (who think he ſpeaks here only of an Idolater or Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; See <hi>Selden, Lib.</hi> I. <hi>de Synedr. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 101.) but a certain manner of ſinning; with deſpight to the Commands of God, and Contempt of his Authority, in any kind of Sin whatſoever. And this <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> himſelf afterward acknowledges, in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. <q>There ſeems to me to be the ſame reaſon in all other Tranſgreſſions, which are committed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly againſt any Law of God, as if an <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi> ſeethed a Kid in its Mother's Milk; or wore heterogeneous Garments, or rounded the Corners of his Head, or his Beard, in contempt of the Law. For the conſequence of this is, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves this Law not to be true: which in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaith he, is the meaning of theſe words, <hi>He reproacheth the LORD.</hi>

But he being not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of any Authority by their Creation, who were added only to give him eaſe, it is more likely this Man was ſet before <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the ſole Judge of this Caſe.

For they obſerve this difference between that Caſe, of the Blaſphemer in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and this here of the Sabbath-breaker, that there they doubted whether he ſhould be puniſhed by them, or by the Hand of Heaven: but here, what kind of Death they ſhould inflict upon him.

                  <hi>The Man be ſurely put to death.]</hi> By this Anſwer, it ſeems to me, the queſtion was not at firſt, What Death he ſhould dye? but whether he ſhould be put to Death or no? That is, Whether the gathering and binding up Sticks into a Faggot, was ſuch a work as is forbidden in the Law, (XX <hi>Exod.</hi>) unto which Death was afterwards threatned in the places before-mentioned. And the Reſolution was, that he ſhould be put to Death, as a Man that denied God, the Creator of the World; though not in words, yet in fact. For he who did any Work on the Sabbath, (as <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> notes upon XX <hi>Exod.</hi>) denied the Work of Creation: though he did not in down-right terms deny God himſelf. For the Sabbath being a <hi>Sign</hi> (as God calls it) that they were the Worſhippers of him, who made all things; the Contempt of that was a renouncing of their Religion, and therefore deſerved to be puniſhed with Death; the Belief of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World being the very Foundation of the Jewiſh Religion; as the belief of its Eternity was the Foundation of the Pagan. This made the breach of this Precept, of keeping the Sabbath ſtrictly, (which is more frequently repeated than any other, for the reaſon fore-mentioned) ſo heinous a Crime, and ſo ſeverely puniſhed: for by this a true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of God was diſtinguiſhed from a profane Perſon and an Idolater.</p>

See XX <hi>Lev.</hi> 2. XXIV. 12. And this Man was condemned to ſuffer it, becauſe he was the firſt breaker of this Sacred Law. And he doing it preſumptuouſly (as is ſuppoſed from the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64708:145"/>
connection of this Story, with <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31.) in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Law; and not deſiſting from his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, when he was admoniſhed to forbear, (as I ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 33.) it highly aggravated his guilt; being no leſs than <hi>a reproaching of the LORD,</hi> and <hi>a deſpiſing of his Word.</hi> Whence the Vulgar ſaying of the <hi>Talmudists, He that denies the Sabbath, is like to him that denies the whole Law.</hi>

For though God did a new thing never heard of before, to demonſtrate theſe People that roſe againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> to be Seditious, yet it was neceſſary ſtill to do more. For after the Earth had ſwallowed up <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> and Fire conſumed <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company, and a Plague deſtroyed many more of them; the LORD did another Miracle, XVII. 8. in making <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod bloſſom, and bud, and bring forth Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds in one Nights time; when all the reſt of the Rods remained dry Sticks. Which makes it probable, as I ſaid before, there were ſome in all the Tribes, who were engaged in this Sedition; and were ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infected with the falſe Notions of <hi>Korah,</hi> that it was neceſſary to give them all this Satisfaction.</p>

For when they came to <hi>Marah,</hi> and could not drink the Waters, becauſe they were bitter, God ſhowed them this Tree, that with it he might make them ſweet. Upon which Tree he afterward placed the brazen Serpent, by looking on which the People were healed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the <hi>Cabbalists</hi> generally tell this Tale; but ſome of them much otherwiſe; who ſay it was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and by him to <hi>Enoch,</hi> and ſo on till it came to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in whoſe Houſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> found it when he died, and brought it to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> from whom <hi>Jethro</hi> ſtole it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with a great deal of ſuch like ſtuff: Which
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64708:166"/>
                  <hi>Abarbinel</hi> ſaith is to be underſtood myſtically. But all the ground they have for this Fancy, of the Rod here laid up being <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod, is from XX. 8, 9. where it is ſaid, That <hi>Moſes took the Rod from before the LORD,</hi> wherewith he brought Water out of the Rock, and this Rod is ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 11. to be <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod. Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> follows this Conceit, and endeavours to find many Myſteries in it. But it is evidently falſe: for as there is not the leaſt intimation here that it was the Rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but quite contrary, it is called <hi>the Rod of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> v. 6. ſo it had not been a ſufficient Argument to convince the Infidelity of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> if <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod had not been of the ſame kind with all the reſt. For they might have aſcribed what came to paſs to the ſingular quality or vertue of that Rod, eſpecially if it were <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod, (wherewith Wonders uſed to be wrought) and not to a ſpecial Hand of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to eſtabliſh the Authority of <hi>Aaron.</hi> And beſides, a Rod full of Bloſſoms and Fruit, had been very unfit to be uſed to ſmite the Rock withal: for which purpoſe that Rod (which ſeems to have been his Paſtoral Staff) wherewith he ſmote the Rock in <hi>Horeb</hi> was moſt proper, XVII <hi>Exod.</hi> 5, 6.</p>

For here were a great many miraculous things concurred together to convince them, that to oppoſe <hi>Aaron,</hi> was to oppoſe God himſelf. The <hi>Jews</hi> reckon up <hi>eight. First,</hi> That <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod ſhould bring forth Buds, Bloſſoms, and Fruit, all in one Night, when the other
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64708:167"/>
Rods, which were of the ſame nature, brought forth nothing. And then <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That the Buds brought forth Leaves; for ſo they interpret thoſe words, <hi>v.</hi> 8. the Rod of <hi>Aaron was budded;</hi> i. e. brought forth Leaves; for the next words ſpeaks of its <hi>budding,</hi> which followed after. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> That it thruſt out Leaves before the Bloſſoms, which is contrary to the Nature of the Almond Tree. And next, that it put forth Bloſſoms all the Rod over; as they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret thoſe words, <hi>bloomed Bloſſoms.</hi> And then that a dry Stick (as they underſtand it) ſhould produce Fruit, and this Fruit <hi>Almonds,</hi> which ſuch Trees (they think) as that Rod was taken from, did not bear. And further, That it produced <hi>ripe Almonds,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Schekedim</hi> imports. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhowed the People all theſe at one view, the Leaves, Buds, Bloſſoms, and Fruit in perfection. By which multiplicity of Miracles the Dignity of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was ſo demonſtrated, that we do not find they at any time hereafter adventured to riſe up againſt him. For beſides all thoſe Wonders now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it may be, that it was not the Seaſon of the Year for Almonds, nor ſo much as for the budding of that Tree: which made it the more aſtoniſhing. But the greateſt thing of all was, the continuing of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to future Ages; which might well make them afraid to open their Mouths again in Murmurings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Aaron.</hi>

But of the Land of <hi>Sihon</hi> and <hi>Og,</hi> (which God beſtowed upon them, as he did the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>) nothing was given to the Prieſts and Levites; for they were admoniſhed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (as they underſtand them) by theſe words, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou have any part among them;</hi> no not of the Spoil.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that of the Land of the Country they were to have no part, God having otherwiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them; that they might attend wholly to his Service, and not ſpend their time in Tilling the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:64708:176"/>
Ground, or feeding Cattle: which would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up their Thoughts very much from their Sacred Employment. Yet the <hi>Levites</hi> had certain Cities and their Suburbs aſſigned to them, XXXV. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which was executed by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as God commanded, XXI <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2, 3.) whereby they were diſperſed among the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they might the better inſtruct the People in the Divine Law, XXXIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> XXX. 22.

                  <hi>I am thy part and thine inheritance among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael.]</hi> For they were maintained in his Houſe, and lived upon his Altar, and fed from his Table; as it is explained in XIII <hi>Joſh.</hi> 14. <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the LORD God of Iſrael made by fire, are their inheritance, as he ſaid unto them.</hi> Which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the reaſon why <hi>Joſhua</hi> gave them no Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And ſee <hi>v.</hi> 33. of that Chapter, where <hi>the LORD God of Iſrael is ſaid to be their Inheritance.</hi> Who, it appears by the foregoing part of this Chapter, and other places, made ſuch an ample Proviſion for them, that if he had given them any part of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> together with it, there had been too great an inequality between them, and the reſt of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For without any ſhare in the Land, their Portion was far richer than that of any other Perſons whatſoever. I have ſaid enough to prove this already, but it may not be amiſs to ſet it before the Reader again, a little more diſtinſtly. As they had yearly the Firſt-fruits of the whole Country, which was at leaſt the <hi>ſixtieth</hi> part of the Fruits it produced; and the <hi>tenth</hi> part of the Tithe given to the <hi>Levites,</hi> (as it follows below <hi>v.</hi> 26.) and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:64708:176"/>
all Free-will-offerings; together with the Money which aroſe out of Perſons and Things devoted unto God; and all the Firſtlings, of Cows, Sheep and Goats; and the Redemption-Money for the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of ſuch Creatures as were unclean: So they had all the Meat-offerings, Offerings for Sin and Treſpaſs-offerings; together with the Breaſt and Shoulder of all Peace-offerings, and the Skins of all Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and the Loaves made of the firſt Dough, and the Shew-bread, and (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> and others expound XVIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.) a conſiderable part of every beaſt that was killed for private uſe; beſides the Cities and Land about them which were aſſigned to the <hi>Levites.</hi> Which if well weighed, there will appear a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Prieſts and the reſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For the Firſt-fruits alone, if they were not leſs than the <hi>ſixtieth</hi> part of the product of the Country might ſeem ſufficient, eſpecially if the Firſtlings be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; the Prieſts not being the <hi>ſixtieth</hi> part of the People; no, nor the <hi>hundred</hi> part, as learned Men have computed.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:64708:177"/>
without repeating the Numbers under it. For it is (as he ſpeaks) the beginning of the ſecond Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the end of the firſt; whereupon all Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do depend. Which our Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in my judgment, far better; who looks upon it as God's favourable dealing with men, in requiring but <hi>the Tenth;</hi> which is in truth <hi>the least part</hi> of their Goods, according to the firſt Diviſion. For when we proceed beyond <hi>Ten,</hi> we begin to make a new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, as <hi>Eleven</hi> is ten and one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we need not have recourſe to ſuch Niceties.

And a larger Inheritance this was than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tribe poſſeſſed: for this was the ſmalleſt Tribe of all, as appears by comparing the account which is given of them, in the beginning of this Book. For all the Males of this Tribe, from a Month old and upward, were but Two and twenty thouſand, III. 29.

                  <hi>To Aaron the Priest.]</hi> This Tythe is thought by ſome to have been deſigned for the High-Prieſt alone. Two great Men in their time were of this Opinion, <hi>viz.

               <p>But there is nothing to ſupport this, but the mere Letter of the Text; for <hi>Joſephus</hi> expreſly ſays the contrary, <hi>Lib.</hi> VI. <hi>Archaeolog. cap.</hi> 4.) and ſo do the generality of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> alſo: that all the Prieſts had their ſhare in this Tenth paid by the <hi>Levites.</hi> Which till it was paid, the <hi>Levites</hi> might not ſpend, to their own uſe, any part of their
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64708:179"/>
Tythe. And to ſecure this, <hi>the Prieſt was to be with the Levites, when they took Tythes,</hi> (as we read X <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> 37, 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) to take care that they ſet out a tenth part of them for the Prieſts. Whereby <hi>the Priest the Son of Aaron,</hi> I cannot think is meant the High-Prieſt himſelf, (for that had been below his Dignity) but ſome Prieſt, I ſuppoſe, appointed by him, who took care of the Concerns of the whole Order of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and particularly of the High-Prieſt's intereſt; who, it is probable, had a principal ſhare among the reſt in this Revenue; perhaps a tenth part out of their Tenth. But for this I have no Authority: though I take it for certain, that when he ſaith this Tenth ſhould be given <hi>to Aaron the Priest,</hi> the meaning is, that, as it was not for himſelf alone, but all his Sons had a ſhare in it, ſo he himſelf was not excluded from an honourable portion of it.</p>
               <p>It may ſeem ſtrange perhaps that there is no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular portion ſet out for the High-Prieſt by himſelf, if this be not it. But it is to be conſidered, that all the forenamed Proviſion (From <hi>v.</hi> 8. to <hi>v.</hi> 20.) was made for him, in the firſt place; and for the Prieſts together with him.

               <p>All this is very plain; but why a young <hi>Cow</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a <hi>Bullock,</hi> (which is commonly appointed in Sacrifices) and why one perfectly red, is not ſo eaſie to underſtand. If we had any reaſon to believe that thoſe Superſtitions were among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which were when <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> lived, we might very probably ſay, (as ſome Men of Learning have) that this Precept was given to preſerve the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their Religion. For they abhorred to offer a Cow, whom they honoured, as ſacred to <hi>Iſis.</hi> So <hi>Herodotus;</hi> they ſacrificed Males, both old and young, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>but it is not lawful for them to offer Females, Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 41. And therefore God, it might be thought, ordered a Cow to be burnt, rather than a Bullock. And for the ſame cauſe one perfectly red, becauſe that was a Colour odious and abominable to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians;</hi> who fancied <hi>Typhon</hi> (the Author of all Evil in their account) to be of that Colour; and therefore offered him red Oxen, as hateful to them, as red Men
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:64708:182"/>
and Aſſes were. Thus <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus.</hi> In oppoſition to which, it may be thought that a Cow of this colour was acceptable to God, becauſe hated and abhorred by thoſe Idolaters. But I look upon what ſuch late Writers ſay, as of no Authority in this matter. And as there is no proof of any ſuch Cuſtoms among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, ſo there is an high probability that the whole Fable of <hi>Typhon</hi> was framed out of the ſtory of <hi>Moſes;</hi> as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi> hath moſt ingeniouſly indeavoured to make out, by many Obſervations out of that Book of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> and other Authors, <hi>Hierozoic. P.</hi> I. <hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 34. <hi>p.</hi> 340, 341, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing the Antiquity of thoſe Superſtitions among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to have been as great as ſome fancy them, I cannot think that if <hi>Moſes</hi> had had any reſpect to them, he would have ordered ſuch a great number of Sacrifices, as we read of in his Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt conſideration of the colour of any one of them, and only mention the colour of this Cow, which was no Sacrifice. I rather think this perfect red colour was choſen, becauſe of its rarity; it being hard to find a Cow without any the leaſt mixture of other hair. And though it were not a Sacrifice, yet being deſigned to the ſame end, there was a reſpect herein to that great Expiation which was made by the Sacrifice of Chriſt. With whoſe Blood, though the Apoſtle doth not compare the Blood of this Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer (becauſe it was not offered) yet he doth compare it with the Aſhes of this burnt Heifer, put into the Water of Purification. See IX <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. Where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Blood of Bulls and Goats, he mentions the <hi>Aſhes of this Heifer ſprinkling the unclean.</hi> For they were a more extraordinary ſort of Purification than any
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:64708:183"/>
under the Law; of which we no where read, but in this place; nor of any Command for the repeated burning of ſuch an Heifer to Aſhes, (as there is for the Anniverſary Sacrifice on the Day of Atonement) but only of the uſe of the Water made of theſe Aſhes, as oft as there was occaſion. But of this it will be more to treat in the following part of the <hi>Chapter.</hi>

                  <hi>That he may bring her forth without the Camp.]</hi> As a thing exceeding unclean; more impure than any common offering for Sin. For the greater the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity was, that was laid upon any Sacrifice, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill off from the Sanctuary it was carried. The Bullock, for inſtance, which was offered for a Sin committed by the Prieſt, or the whole Congregation, was in part offered at the Altar; but the far greater part was to be burnt without the Camp, IV <hi>Lev.</hi> 12, 20. And ſo was the Bullock and Goat, offered for all the Sins of the People, on the great Day of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, XVI <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. And the Scape-Goat, which
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:64708:183"/>
was deſigned for the ſame purpoſe, was not ſo much as burnt, but baniſhed into a Land not inhabited, no Body knows whether. All which more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly repreſented Chriſt in his Sufferings, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle obſerves, XIII <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11, 12. and ſo did this in part; having ſomething of the nature of a Sacrifice in it. For though it was not a Sacrifice brought to be ſlain at the Altar, yet it was intended to be uſed to the ſame purpoſe, for the cleanſing of the People from the greateſt Legal defilement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And one ſhall ſlay her before his face.]</hi> Some Perſon appointed by <hi>Eleazar</hi> (for it was not neceſſary a Prieſt ſhould do it) was to kill her without the Camp. Where it is plain from <hi>v.</hi> 5, 8, 9. there were more than one concerned in this Office. But it could not be ſlain unleſs <hi>Eleazar</hi> was there; and it was to be done in his preſence, who was the chief of the Prieſts: to ſhow that it was intended for God's Service, though not offered as Sacrifices were at the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, before the LORD. And this is the reaſon perhaps, why the care of this Heifer is committed to <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and not to <hi>Aaron;</hi> becauſe he officiated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Tabernacle.</p>

Therefore though this was not a Sacrifice, yet it had ſomething of that nature in it, and may be called a <hi>Piaculum,</hi> an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Thing: though nothing was called KOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAN, <hi>a Sacrifice,</hi> but what was offered at the Altar, as our Dr. <hi>Owtram</hi> hath moſt judiciouſly obſerved

Towards which the Prieſt was to look ſtedfaſtly while he ſprinkled it: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the Jews ſay, it was in vain. Which ſhows that the validity of this Act, and of the Purification to be made by it, was to be expected from the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. For the Blood of that Heifer, whoſe Head was cut off to cleanſe a City, near to which a Man was found ſlain by an unknown Perſon, was not ſprinkled; being ſlain, not in ſight of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, but in a Valley, near the City, XXI <hi>Deut.</hi> 3, 4, &amp;c. And in this the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo curious, that after the Temple was built, this Blood being to be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led directly before the Porch of it, they took care the Gate <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> which was before it, ſhould have lower Battlements than any other Gate of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had, that the Prieſt might ſee the Face of the Porch of the Houſe of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seven times.]</hi> This ſignifies the perfection of the Expiation that was to be made by this red Cow; on whoſe Aſhes the <hi>Jews</hi> thought ſo much depended, that they took care the Prieſt, who was to ſee her burnt, ſhould be put apart in a Chamber of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (called <hi>the Houſe of Stone</hi>) that they might be certain he was free from all pollution by a Grave, or a dead Corps. For the Aſhes of this burnt Cow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great and only cleanſer for that Defilement, they took ſuitable care that he ſhould not be defiled who went to burn her.

chap.</hi> 17. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. where he deſcribes out of <hi>Maimonides</hi> and others, how ſolemnly the Prieſt was attended, when he went about this work. And the Apoſtle had reaſon to mention the Aſhes of this Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, wherewith the Water was made for ſprinkling the Unclean, as the Principal Thing that <hi>ſanctified to the purifying of the Fleſh,</hi> i. e. taking away bodily Defilements. With which he compares the Blood of Chriſt as infinitely more powerful, for the <hi>purifying of the Conſcience from dead works,</hi> IX <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13, 14. In which words, <hi>dead works,</hi> there is a reſpect (as our Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> obſerves) to the main intention of theſe Aſhes, which were for the Purification of thoſe defiled by dead Bodies. And he ſeems to me alſo, not to be led by Fancy, but by a ſolid Judgment, when he conſidered theſe Aſhes alſo as a notable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the everlaſting Efficacy of Chriſt's Blood, of which the Apoſtle there diſcourſes. For if the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſion for the uſe of the Water of Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had not ſpent all the Aſhes of this Heifer now ſlain and burnt by <hi>Eleazar,</hi> they might have been preſerved for this purpoſe without any danger of Putrifaction, for a longer time than the Law of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies laſted.

                  <hi>For the Congregation of the Children of Iſrael.]</hi> This one Heifer, being ſlain, and its Blood ſprinkled, and Body burnt, afforded Aſhes enough to ſeaſon as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Veſſels of Water, as the whole People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould need.

Congregation; and thoſe <hi>things</hi> alſo which had been defiled, were reſtored to their common uſe.

But the Water into which they put them was prepared with Magical Rites; and, for the moſt part, was drawn out of ſome pretended Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Fountain; and ſometimes it had a burning Torch taken from the Altar, quenched in it; and in ſome places they put Sulphur, and Spittle, and other cleanſing things into it. In which, I ſuppoſe, at firſt they imitated this Rite preſcribed by <hi>Moſes;</hi> but in proceſs of time added many Superſtitions of their own to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a purification for ſin.]</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the words are, <hi>It is ſin:</hi> and we add <hi>a purification,</hi> to explain the ſence. For it was not a proper Sacrifice for Sin, (as this Phraſe <hi>for ſin</hi> ſometimes imports, IV <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.) but had ſomething of that Nature in it, (as I obſerved before) and may be properly ſaid to Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, or Cleanſe Men from their Sin; i. e. from ſuch Legal Defilements as are mentioned afterwards. And it may, in a leſs proper ſence, have the Name of a <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> inaſmuch as the Body of it was burnt without the Camp, (as the great Sin-offering was on the Day of Atonement) and its Blood ſprinkled ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times towards the Sanctuary; though not ſhed at the Altar: Whereby it became a more compleat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Sacrifice of Chriſt. Eſpecially if we conſider that this <hi>Purification</hi> here mentioned, doth not ſignifie only one, or a few Acts of Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but a <hi>continued Purification:</hi> the Aſhes being to be laid up as a Treaſure or Store-houſe (to uſe Dr.

                  <hi>Jackſon's</hi> words) for making as many Purifications, or Waters of Sprinkling, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould have occaſion to uſe. For therein conſiſted the Excellence of this <hi>Purification,</hi> that the Aſhes were not to be made by burning a Heifer, every time the People had occaſion for them; but the Aſhes of this one Sacrifice (as we call it) was ſufficient for the uſe of many Generations.

The plaineſt account of it, I think, is this, which none of them take notice of; That the Water now ceaſing at the ſame time that <hi>Miriam</hi> died, <hi>Moſes</hi> was very ſad both for her Death, and perhaps for the Ceaſing of the Water: And being unexpectedly aſſaulted by the People, who ought to have had a greater Reverence for him, in a time of Mourning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, it was the occaſion of a greater Commotion of Anger and Indignation, than was uſually in him. Which gave him ſuch a Diſturbance in his Mind, and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:64708:196"/>
ſo diſordered his Thoughts, that when God bad him take his Rod, and go and ſpeak to the Rock, he fell into ſome doubt, whether God would grant them the Favour he had done before; either, becauſe they were ſo wretched a People, that it was not fit God ſhould do any thing for them; or becauſe he thought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Water might be otherways procured for them. And becauſe of this doubting, I ſuppoſe, it might be that upon the firſt ſtriking of the Rock, no Water came forth; (God alſo perhaps ſo ordering it, that he might try him) and hereupon his Diffidence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed into Unbelief, and a ſettled Perſwaſion they ſhould have no Water. His Anger alſo at ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Generation, it is likely, made him the more diſtruſtful, that God would do nothing for them. For both theſe are mentioned by the Divine Writers that touch upon this Hiſtory, that he <hi>did not believe;</hi> and that his Spirit was ſo provoked, that <hi>he ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly with his lips,</hi> (CVI <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32, 33.) which was when he ſpake thoſe words <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Must we fetch you Water out of this Rock?</hi> i. e. <hi>is that a likely matter?</hi> They being words of the ſame ſort with thoſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> XVIII <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. <hi>Shall I of a ſurety have a Child, who am old?</hi> that is, <hi>I cannot believe it.</hi> And when he ſaw the Water did not come out at the firſt ſtroke, he might be ſo raſh as to ſay, <hi>Now it is plain God will give you none, but let you periſh:</hi> or words to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>I know nothing more probable than this; unleſs the Reader likes the Opinion of <hi>Joſeph Albo</hi> better, which is the <hi>ninth</hi> Opinion mentioned by <hi>Abarbinel:</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> having had ſuch long Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God's goodneſs to this People, and of his readineſs to help them, ought not to have gone and

For now the Tabernacle was built, and they had God dwelling among them, (which they had not when he ſmote the Rock at firſt) which ought to have bred in them the higheſt Aſſurance that God would ſupply them. Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> hath another Conjecture, (which I ſhall propound that the Reader may judge which is moſt likely) That <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> began to diſtruſt God's Promiſe of entring into the promiſed Land, at the end of <hi>forty</hi> Years; imagining that if they brought Water again out of the Rock, it muſt follow them, as long as the other had done. For this he makes the ſence of their words, <hi>What ye Rebels! must we bring Water out of a Rock, as we did at</hi> Horeb? <hi>Are all our Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of getting out of the Wilderneſs come to this? We never fetcht you Water out of a Rock but once; and that was becauſe ye were to ſtay a long time in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now that is gone, must we fetch Water out of another Rock?

               <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> cannot but acknowledge a <hi>Myſtery</hi> in this brazen Serpent, as <hi>Moſes Gerundenſis</hi> calls it: which our LORD Chriſt himſelf hath explained in his Diſcourſe with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> III <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:64708:208"/>
must the Son of Man be lifted up: that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhould not periſh,</hi> &amp;c. Where he doth not compare himſelf to the Brazen Serpent, (for what likeneſs can there be found between the Serpent and the Seed of the Woman; or how ſhould Light, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore-ſhadowed by Darkneſs, as Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> ſpeaks) but he compares the lifting up of this Serpent on the Pole, with his Lifting up, or Crucifixion on the Croſs. For ſo he himſelf expreſſes his Death, and the manner of it, XII <hi>John</hi> 32. <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the Earth, will draw all Men unto me.</hi> And their looking on the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently repreſented Mens believing on Chriſt; and their Cure, the powerful Vertue of Chriſt's Death to preſerve all thoſe that believe on him <hi>from periſhing,</hi> (as he ſpeaks in the place named before) and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for them <hi>everlasting Life.</hi> For by his Death, our Saviour <hi>deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is the Devil,</hi> (as the Apoſtle's words are, II <hi>Hebr.</hi> 14.) which was notably repreſented in this Brazen Serpent put upon a Pole: which was not a Figure of Chriſt, but of the old Serpent himſelf (the Devil) as wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bruiſed, and dead, by the Lifting up of Chriſt upon the Croſs; where he intirely diſarmed him of all his Power to hurt us.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell whence <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> concluded, this Brazen Serpent to have been made in the form of a Croſs, as he ſaith it was in his <hi>Second Apology;</hi> unleſs we conceive it to have been made with Wings at the bottom of its Neck, which might give it that Figure. But his obſervation in his Book againſt <hi>Trypho (p.</hi> 322, 338.) ſeems very conſiderable; that there muſt be ſome Myſtery in it, that God, who forbad all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Images, ſhould now command one to be made:
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:64708:209"/>
of which, he ſaith, one of the <hi>Jews</hi> confeſſed he could never hear a Reaſon from their Doctors. Who cannot underſtand it, till they believe in Chriſt and him crucified; whoſe Victory over the Devil, by his Croſs and Paſſion, was herein moſt lively repreſented. I ſhall only add, that this <hi>Lifting up the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> was a thing ſo publick, and ſo well known to all Neighbouring Nations, that the fame of it, in all likelyhood, went into <hi>India.</hi> Where they ſtill ſet up an <hi>Idol</hi> in form of a wreathed Serpent, upon a Perch ſix or ſeven Foot high, which they ſolemnly worſhip. And carrying it along with them in their Travels, ſet it up every Morning for the Company to pay their Adorations to it. So <hi>Taverneir</hi> relates in his Travels to that Country, <hi>p.</hi> 28. And ſee the preſent Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s excellent Treatiſe of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, p.</hi> 351, &amp;c. with <hi>Huetius</hi> his <hi>Demonſtr.

Of which the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo fond, that they <hi>burnt Incenſe to it</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and had done ſo we know not how long, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XVIII. 4. Which may make it the leſs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the poor <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould worſhip a <hi>Serpent</hi> upon a Pole, when they that ſhould have underſtood better, committed ſuch a foul Idolatry, as to do Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honour to the Figure of the greateſt Enemy of God and of Mankind.</p>

about this Matter: which, if he had been a faithful Servant of God, he would inſtantly have rejected with Diſdain. And it is likely enough, by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that he was as deſirous of their Money, as they were of his Imprecations.</p>

addreſs himſelf for Advice unto the LORD; who they knew would be favourable to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And on the other ſide, ſome Chriſtians have been of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he addreſſed himſelf to the LORD, only to try if he could draw him by his Charms, to take part with the <hi>Moabites:</hi> Juſt as the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they laid Siege to a City, endeavoured by all means they could invent, to perſwade the Tutelar Gods of that place to forſake it, and come over to their ſide.

And here it will be fit to note, That all Nations, of whom we have any knowledge, have been poſſeſſed with this Opinion, that God was wont to appear frequently unto Men; eſpecially, <hi>cum recentes à Deo eſſent,</hi> (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>Epist.</hi> XC.) when they were newly come out of his hand: and that he alſo was pleaſed to reveal his Mind and Will unto them, by ſome means or other; particularly by his Angels, whom he ſent on Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to them, as long as there was any Goodneſs left among them.

See <hi>Huetius</hi> in his <hi>Quaeſtiones Alnetanae, Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 1, 2. And indeed no account can be given how it came into the Head of <hi>Homer,</hi> and other Poets, to bring in the Gods appearing ſo oft, as they do, upon every occaſion, if God had not been wont, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time, to manifeſt himſelf, not only to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> but to other Nations alſo, eſpecially before the diſtinction of this People from them. So he did to <hi>Abimelech, Laban,</hi> &amp;c. as well as to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> For, as Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> hath well obſerved (in his <hi>first</hi> Book upon the <hi>Creed, chap.</hi> 11.) if they had never heard nor read of any ſuch thing, all the Wits in the World, had they beat their Brains never ſo much, could not have thought of bringing the Gods in a viſible ſhape upon the Stage; or interlacing their Poems with their frequent Apparitions. Nor can any other account be given, how this came to be the common Belief of the World, from one end of it to the other, that the Gods revealed their Mind to Men: the Philoſophers, as well as ordinary People, in the <hi>East, West, North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> making no doubt of it.

               </p>
               <p>But when Mankind degenerated, and corrupted themſelves by all manner of Wickedneſs, then God forſook them, and permitted evil Angels to take the place of the good, and plunge Mankind further into all manner of Filthineſs; eſpecially into abominable Idolatries.

Spirits; of whom he learnt Inchantments. But at this time God was pleaſed again to appear to him himſelf, for the good of his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to over-rule all his bad Inclinations: Inſomuch that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays at laſt he did not go, as he had done, to <hi>ſeek Inchantments,</hi> (XXIV. 1.) but gave up himſelf wholly, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to the Conduct of God's Spirit, as I ſhall there obſerve.</p>

But there is no ground for the conceit of <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> who, in his Preface to <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, ſect.</hi> 4. ſaith, <hi>Balaam</hi> ordered this in emulation of the <hi>ſeven</hi> acceptable Altars to God, built by <hi>ſeven</hi> Men famous for Piety; <hi>viz, Adam, Abel, Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Moſes.</hi> There is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in this, that theſe Altars were erected in honour either of the moſt High, or of the greateſt of their Gods. For according to the account, which both

The only doubt is, to whom theſe Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were offered. I ſuppoſe each of them had their ſeveral Intentions: <hi>Balak</hi> ſupplicating <hi>Baal</hi> by them; and <hi>Balaam</hi> making his Prayer to the LORD, though with ſuch Superſtitious Ceremonies, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as were uſed by the Worſhippers of <hi>Baal;</hi> in one of whoſe High-places theſe Sacrifices were offered.

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:64708:233"/>
to other Gods. And it appears evidently from <hi>v.</hi> 4. that he pretended to Sacrifice unto God; and would not have preſumed ſurely to tell him ſo, if he meant otherwiſe.</p>

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:64708:239"/>
places where this word is found. The only difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, what Creature it is which is here called <hi>Reem;</hi> which we tranſlate (as many others have done) an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn:</hi> which though moſt now take to be a fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Creature, that is not in being, yet <hi>Tho. Bartholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in his <hi>Anotomical Hiſtories (Centur.</hi> II. <hi>Hiſtor.</hi> 61.) tells us, that an Ambaſſador from the King of <hi>Guinea</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Curland,</hi> aſſured him at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> that there is a Beaſt in <hi>Africa</hi> of the bigneſs of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Horſe, very ſwift and fierce, which hath a Horn in its Forehead, about three Spans in length; the dead Carcaſe of which he had ſeen, though never one alive. But if this be ſuppoſed to be true, it is not the Creature here meant; for it is plain by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that the <hi>Reem</hi> hath two Horns, XXXIII <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. where we read of the <hi>Horns of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> (as we tranſlate it) to which the two Tribes of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> are compared. See alſo XXII <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. Therefore the famous <hi>Bochartus,</hi> after along diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other Opinions, thinks it moſt probable that the <hi>Reem</hi> is a kind of Goat, which the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazel,</hi> and is now called <hi>Gazellas;</hi> which is a tall Creature (ſome of them as high as a Stag) with long and ſharp Horns.

words of a later Writer of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, <hi>R. Iſaac</hi> in his <hi>Illumin. Fidei,</hi> ſet forth not long ago by the learned <hi>Wagenſeil:</hi> Where he argues this cannot be underſtood of <hi>David,</hi> or any other King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe none of them ever reigned over all the Earth, (i. e. <hi>over all the Children of</hi> Seth, whom none of them deſtroyed) but it is meant, he concludes, of the MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAH; who is compared to a Star, becauſe of the perennity of his Kingdom, and the ſplendor of his Dominion, and his great Acts throughout the World, <hi>p.</hi> 72, and 80. Where he makes this a Prophecy of one Kingdom alone to be in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who are called <hi>the People of the Saints of the most High,</hi> VII <hi>Dan.</hi> 27. Which is true enough, if he had underſtood the right meaning of <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> who are thoſe, not after the Fleſh, but after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>It is not fit to conclude this without one Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, that ſo long ago as the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Adrian,</hi> this was underſtood by the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to be a Prophecy of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> For they followed one whoſe Name was <hi>Chocab</hi> (i. e. <hi>a Star</hi>) to whom the famous <hi>R. Akiba</hi> (a Doctor, who, they ſay, had Four and twenty thouſand Scholars) applied theſe words of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and calling him <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choceb,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Son of a Star,</hi> anointed him their King, and carried a Sword before him, crying, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the very King Meſſiah.</hi> This is reported by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves in <hi>Tzenach David,</hi> and ſeveral other Books. All which, I think, doth not hinder, but that King <hi>David</hi> may be hereby ſignified in the firſt ſence; though as a Type of the MESSIAH, the great Son of <hi>David,</hi> in whom it was complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>And a Scepter ſhall riſe out of Iſrael.]</hi> This ſome think may firſt have a reſpect to <hi>David,</hi> and then to the MESSIAH, <hi>the King of Iſrael.</hi> But the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> paraphraſt refers the whole to <hi>Christ,</hi> whoſe words are theſe, <hi>A King ſhall ariſe out of the Houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and the Meſſiah ſhall be anointed of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael. Nor is it any wonder that <hi>Balaam</hi> ſhould propheſie of him, ſo many years before he was born, and ſo plainly, that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf doth not ſpeak in plainer terms: but it is to be lookt upon as the effect of God's infinite Goodneſs, who would not have thoſe, that were not of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what he intended to do for all Mankind. And this was neceſſary to be plainly told them, becauſe otherwiſe they would not have underſtood it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhall ſmite the Corners of Moab.]</hi> The latter part of this Prophecy, <hi>Huetius</hi> thinks, belongs to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> as the former part to <hi>Christ.</hi> Which was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> who divided the Prophecy between them. And this was indeed literally fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>David,</hi> who ſubdued the <hi>Moabites</hi> intirely, as we read 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> VIII. 8. LX <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. CVIII. 9. Some tranſlate theſe words, <hi>He ſhall ſmite through the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Moab.</hi> So the LXX. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: which doth not alter the ſence. And it is no unuſual thing with the Prophets, when they intend to ſpeak of ſomething nearer to them, to be tranſported by the Spirit of God, to ſpeak of things a great deal more remote. As <hi>Balaam</hi> here foretelling a great Ruler ſhould come out of <hi>Jacob,</hi> firſt ſpeaks of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all, above Fourteen hundred years after his time; and then of <hi>David,</hi> who reigned about Four hundred years after this.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>And deſtroy all the Children of Sheth.]</hi> They who interpret this of <hi>David,</hi> take <hi>Sheth</hi> to have been ſome great Perſon in that Country, or ſome Place of great note, the Inhabitants of which are here threatned to be deſtroyed. But theſe are mere conjectures, which have no foundation in Hiſtory: whereas, if we underſtand it of <hi>Christ,</hi> and tranſlate the firſt word, not <hi>he ſhall deſtroy,</hi> but (as <hi>Caſtalio</hi> and others do) <hi>he ſhall rule over,</hi> the ſence is very remarkable. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prophecy, that in the times of the MESSIAH, there ſhall be no longer ſuch a diſtinction, as God now made between the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and other Nations, (by the peculiar Laws he gave them at their entrance into <hi>Canaan</hi>) but all Mankind, who are equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Seth,</hi> ſhall be united under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And thus not only <hi>Lyranus</hi> and <hi>Abulenſis</hi> and others interpret it, but <hi>Onkelos</hi> alſo, whoſe words are, <hi>He ſhall have dominion over all the Sons of Men.</hi> For he thought it reaſonable by <hi>the Children of Seth</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all Mankind, who were propagated from him, who ſucceeded in the place of <hi>Abel</hi> that was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; all the Seed of <hi>Cain</hi> periſhing in the Flood.</p>

Another great Man of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath ſaid much to ſtrengthen this Opinion; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhown at large, that the ancient Heathens were wont to Deify the Souls of Men, and Canonize them after Death; and theſe we called <hi>Baalim.</hi> Being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an inferiour ſort of Deities, who they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied were Miniſters for them, to their Caeleſtial Gods.

he conſulted the LORD, after this manner; but as ſoon as ever he was dead they did, I <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. From whence <hi>Abarbinel</hi> concludes, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> was bound to do this only at the firſt entrance upon his Office, that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> might know he was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Succeſſor, and that God was with him: but that afterward the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecy reſted upon him, and conducted him without this Oracle. But if nothing was done, that is not recorded in the Scripture, he might as well have ſaid, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> never conſulted the Oracle at all; for we do not read he did, though he be here ſo ordered. <hi>R. Levi ben Gerſom</hi> therefore ſeems to me to ſpeak more reaſonably, when he ſays, that thoſe words in the beginning of the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> do not import that they did not conſult God by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> in the Life of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> but only that after his Death, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would not adventure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the War of <hi>Canaan,</hi> without the ſame dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>And there is ſomething elſe, which they might have obſerved from this <hi>verſe,</hi> with great reaſon, which is, how much inferiour <hi>Joſhua</hi> was to <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he ſucceeded him in the Conduct of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For <hi>Moſes</hi> never made uſe of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> to conſult God by the High-Prieſt; but went directly and immediately to God himſelf: whereas <hi>Joſhua</hi> was not admitted to ſuch Familiarity; nor had he ſuch frequent Revelations from God as <hi>Moſes</hi> had. Yet ſometimes God vouchſafed him the honour, to ſpeak to him, as we find in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> III. 7. IV. 1, 15, &amp;c. And there was a moſt illuſtrious appearance of God to him before <hi>Jericho,</hi> V. 13, &amp;c.</p>

In this we ſee the great <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>22</label> Integrity, the ſincere Humility and Self-denial of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he readily ſubmitted to have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Iſrael</hi> tranſlated from his own Family and Tribe unto another; who was of the Tribe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim.</hi> Whereby his own Children were reduced to a mean condition; being not ſo much as Prieſts, but mere Levites. This demonſtrates he acted not <hi>from</hi> himſelf, becauſe he acted not <hi>for</hi> himſelf; but was contented to have the Supreme Authority placed where God pleaſed, both in Church and State; and to leave his own Family in an inconſiderable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This ſhows him to have had a Principle, which raiſed him above all other Law-givers; who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways took care to advance their own Families, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh them in ſome ſhare of that greatneſs which they themſelves poſſeſſed. This likewiſe demonſtrates that the future Rulers of this Nation, had no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to advance the Credit of <hi>Moſes,</hi> beyond what it really was; ſince they were not deſcended from him, but were of other Tribes.</p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>And he laid his hands upon him, and gave <label type="milestone">

               <p>
                  <hi>In due ſeaſon.]</hi> For that reaſon this Sacrifice was to be conſtantly offered, ſaith the ſame Author, that the Divine Fire which came down from Heaven to conſume the Sacrifices, might not be diſappointed, and burn there in vain, without any thing to do.</p>
               <p>From this place the <hi>Jews</hi> endeavour to make out their Cuſtom, of having <hi>Stationary men,</hi> as they call them, to attend the daily Sacrifice: taking <hi>Moatho [in its ſeaſon]</hi> as if it had been <hi>Omatho [in its ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons]</hi> but chiefly relying upon the firſt words of this <hi>verſe, command the Children of Iſrael,</hi> who could not all be preſent at the daily Sacrifice, and therefore ſome
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:64708:280"/>
particular Perſons were choſen to repreſent all the reſt. For they thought it very undecent to have a Sacrifice made for a Man, and he not ſtand by it; and therefore the firſt Prophets ordained Twenty four Courſes of Men choſen out of the Prieſts, Levites, and People, to ſtand in the Temple, when the daily Sacrifice was offered in the name of all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and pray that God would accept it for them, as if they were all preſent.

See there: which was uſual at all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Sacrifices, (as I noted before) otherways, the Feaſt of blowing with Trumpets, was only on the New Moon of the ſeventh Month, and no other.

<pb n="568" facs="tcp:64708:288"/>
Jubilation, Triumph, and Shouting for Joy: the word <hi>teruah</hi> being never uſed in Scripture, but for a ſound, or ſhout of Gladneſs, as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> word <hi>Jabbaba,</hi> which is here uſed by the Paraphraſt, always ſignifies. And this agrees with their Notion, who think it was a ſpecial remembrance of the Creation of the World, at which the Angels rejoyced. Or, it might be ordained to ſtir up the People to a grateful remembrance of all God's Benefits the Year paſt. Whatſoever was the cauſe, certain it is, this <hi>ſeventh</hi> Month was very famous on this account, that more ſolemn days were to be kept in it, than in all the Year beſides. And upon that account, the People might be awakened, by this blowing of Trumpets, to obſerve them aright.</p>

From whence the ſaying among the Doctors, That <hi>Vows are the hedge of Separation;</hi> i. e. a great guard to an holy Life. But ſince, through the vehemence of their Affections and Paſſions, many Women are prone to act unadviſedly, if Vows were wholly in their power, great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, Diſſentions and Confuſions might ariſe in Families, whilſt this ſort of Meat is lawful to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but not to the Wife; this permitted to the Daughter, but prohibited to the Mother.

This hath made ſome think, he was the fitter to go and to avenge the LORD of <hi>Midian,</hi> as he had begun to do, XXV. 8. In af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times alſo, in the days of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who were of the Family of the Prieſts, the Armies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were led by them againſt their Enemies. But then it muſt be conſidered, that they were alſo the Supream Governours of the People, and there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> which ſome think <hi>Phineas</hi> carried along with him, wherewith to conſult the Divine Majeſty, in caſe of any difficulty, that might ariſe about the management of the War. And to make out this, they ſuppoſe <hi>Eleazar</hi> to be old and crazy, or labouring under ſome Infirmity, which was the reaſon that <hi>Phineas</hi> his Son was ſubſtituted in his room to perform this Office. See our very learned Dr. <hi>Spencer, Diſſert. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim &amp; Thummim, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. But this may be juſtly doubted, whether <hi>Phineas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Son of the High-Prieſt, and not yet ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:64708:297"/>
of that Office, could be ſubſtituted to perform this great Charge, which belonged to the High-Prieſt alone. Nor do we find any warrant for conſulting the LORD by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt holy Place, (See XXVII. 21.) And therefore it ſeems to me far more likely, that he means the <hi>Ark,</hi> which was wont to be carried, in following times, into the Field, when they went to fight with their Enemies, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> IV. 4, 5. XIV. 18. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XI. 1. Yea, <hi>Joſhua</hi> himſelf, not long after this time, ordered the Ark to be carried, with Prieſts blowing the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets before it, when he ſurrounded <hi>Jericho,</hi> VI <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4, 6, 7, &amp;c. And therefore the <hi>holy Inſtruments</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here joyned with <hi>the Trumpets to blow in his hand,</hi> it makes it the more probable, that the <hi>Ark</hi> may be here meant. There being alſo ſomething in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Book, to countenance this Opinion. See XIV. 44. but eſpecially XXXII. 20, 22.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be confeſſed, that it is never thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in any other place of Holy Scripture, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways called the <hi>Ark of God,</hi> or of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> or the <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> or the like. And therefore, perhaps, they give the trueſt ſence of theſe words, who take the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words to be an Explication of them. That is, the <hi>Trumpets</hi> were the <hi>holy Inſtruments,</hi> which he carried in his hand.</p>

                  <hi>And the Trumpets to blow, in his hand.]</hi> Which he delivered to the Prieſts who followed him, to ſound an Alarm, when they went to fight; according to the direction X. 8, 9. and as the practice was in future Ages, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XIII. 12.</p>

III. 9. So that their Father muſt have two Names, <hi>Kenaz</hi> and <hi>Jephunneh.</hi> But it is very ſtrange, if this be true, that <hi>Caleb</hi> is no where called the Son of <hi>Kenaz,</hi> but conſtantly the Son of <hi>Jephun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neh</hi> (even there where <hi>Othniel</hi> is juſt before called the Son of <hi>Kenaz,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.13, 15.) nor is <hi>Othniel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where called the Son of <hi>Jephunneh,</hi> but always of <hi>Kenaz.</hi> And indeed there is a demonſtration againſt this Opinion; for <hi>Othniel</hi> married <hi>Caleb</hi>'s Daughter, which by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was utterly unlawful,
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:64708:309"/>
whatſoever the practice might have been before the Law was given.

                  <hi>According to theſe judgments.]</hi> Upon Trial they proceeded to give Judgment, according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Rules: which in brief are theſe. If a Man had no intention to kill another, but it was purely involuntary, he was to be acquitted. If there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared any deſign upon his Life, or ſuch hatred and enmity, as might move them to conclude he had an intention to kill him, he was to be put to death. But here the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the killing of a Man into three kinds. The <hi>first</hi> was, when, though it was from pure Ignorance and Error, yet there was ſome Negligence in it, which a prudent Man might have avoided. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> when a Man kills another ignorantly, and cannot be blamed for any negligence, becauſe ſuch a thing ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens. An Example of the <hi>first</hi> they make to be, when a Man coming down a Ladder falls upon another, and kills him. An Example of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> when going up a Ladder, a Man happens to do the ſame. The former is more frequent, and therefore
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:64708:335"/>
they ſay, hath ſome kind of blame in it; the other ſeldomer, and therefore hath none. A <hi>third</hi> kind, when any Man kills another out of ignorance and error alſo, but it approaches nearer to voluntary Murder. As when a Man, intending to kill one Man, happens to kill another, with a Stone or otherwiſe. In none of theſe caſes, they ſay, the Court of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could put any Man to Death. And the Cities of Refuge were not provided for the <hi>ſecond</hi> or <hi>third</hi> ſort, but only for the <hi>firſt;</hi> and that when the Man died preſently, and did not lye and languiſh of the Wound: for if he did, it might be ſuppoſed he died by his own negligence, or other ways, as well as by the Wound. In which caſe there was no need, that the Man who wounded him, ſhould flee to the City of Refuge; nor could the Avenger of Blood meddle with him: No more than he could with a Father, when he gave his Son, or a Maſter, when he gave his Scholar Correction, and hapned to kill him. The ſame was the caſe of him, whoſe Office it was to Arreſt Men, by Publick Authority, and bring them before the Judges, if he ſtruck a Man that refuſed to go along with him, and killed him.

For it is manifeſt in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that in the Apoſtles time all the Publick Acts of the Church were paſſed at the Publick Aſſemblies of the ſame.

                  <pb n="665" facs="tcp:64708:336"/>
Laws (which plainly ſhow they were borrowed in great part from <hi>Moſes</hi>) for he who ſlew a Man invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, was forced to fly his Country. So the <hi>Scoliast</hi> upon the laſt of <hi>Homer's Iliads,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. It was the manner in ancient times, for a Man that had killed another involuntarily, to flee his Country; and betaking himſelf to ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring place, to ſit with his Face covered, begging to be expiated. But this was only for a certain time, as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> tells us (in his Oration in <hi>Ariſtocratem</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="666" facs="tcp:64708:337"/>
and moſt dear to every one in the Nation. Which made the Publick Grief ſo great when he died, that Men forgot their private Reſentments: For nothing could fall out more grievous to all People, (ſaith he) then the Death of the High-Prieſt, which ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up all other Grief, <hi>More Nevoch. P.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 40.</q>
And in the mean time the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, that the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the place, were bound to teach him ſome Trade, whereby he might provide himſelf with Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries: And he had this comfort alſo, during his abſence from his own Family, that the Mother of the High-Prieſt ſent him many Gifts, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there more contentedly, and not pray for the Death of the High-Prieſt. So they tell us in the place fore mentioned, <hi>Maccoth cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. Where they alſo obſerve, that if a Man killed the High-Prieſt, or the High-Prieſt himſelf hapned to kill a Man invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, they were to ſtay in the City of Refuge as long as they lived: yet they found this temperament, that if one who had been High-Prieſt, but removed from his Office, was alive when the ſlaughter was committed; after his death, both he that killed the High-Prieſt or any other unawares, and the High-Prieſt himſelf, who had done the ſame, were ſet free from the City of Refuge. See <hi>Selden, Lib.</hi> II. <hi>de Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedr. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. and <hi>Lib.</hi> III. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>There may ſeem to be ſome inequality in this Law, becauſe as ſome High-Prieſts lived long, and others but a ſhort time, ſo ſome Man-ſlayers fled to the City at the beginning of their Prieſthood, and others juſt before their death. But it muſt be conſidered that this could not be better ordered, than to make the Man-ſlayer's Liberty depend upon the death of the High-Prieſt, whenſoever it fell out; that an higher
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:64708:337"/>
value might be ſet upon him; and that it might repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our Deliverance only by the Death of the Son of God; of which many great Men look upon this as a Type or Shadow: though, it muſt be confeſſed, there is not the leaſt ſignification of this in the N. Teſtament. And ſince the great Expiation, which the High-Prieſt made every year on the Day of Atonement, did not procure ſuch Men their Liberty, I cannot look upon it as the effect of the High-Prieſt's Death, but only as that which followed upon it, by vertue of this Law. For the High-Prieſt having a great power every where, and particularly in theſe Cities of the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, over whom he was the chief, it is poſſible the Man-ſlayer might be confined here by ſome peculiar Act of his Authority; which expiring, together with himſelf, he was releaſed.</p>

In like manner, when Churches became places of Refuge, the Civil Law allowed the priviledge to extend to the Church-gate: and the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> to thirty Paces from the Church; which Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> enlarged to forty. Thus among the Heathen, the Bounds of the Refuge at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> was ſometimes more and ſometimes leſs, as <hi>Ritterhuſius</hi> obſerves in his Book before-named, where he ſhows how far it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
